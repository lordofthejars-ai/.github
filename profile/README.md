## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains several examples that I use to integrate Java and AI. These projects show the usage of LangChain4j, LangGraph4j, or DJL.

This is the list of projects, as I have presented them. However, each repository has its own README with information on what to expect, including a video demo and instructions about how to deploy on your computer or Kubernetes.

* **Event-Driven AI** (https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/event-driven-ai): Example using Quarkus, Kafka, Debezium, and DJL to implement an event-driven application for analyzing sentiment analysis.

* **Fraud Detection** (https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/fraud-detection-inference): Example using Quarkus and DJL for fraud detection on bank transactions. Predictive AI example.

* **Insurance Claim Processing** (https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/insurance-claim-processing-ai-java): Example using Quarkus, DJL, and LangChain4j for analyzing a car accident picture, generating reports, and summary information.

* **Face Cover Emoji** (https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/face-cover-emoji): Example using Quarkus, DJL, and OpenCV for detecting faces and covering them with an emoji.

* **Passport Extractor** (https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/passport-extractor): Example using Quarkus, YOLO, OpenCV, and Tessaract (OCR) for analyzing images of passports and extracting important information.

* **Recommendation with Vectors** (https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/recommendation-with-vectors): Example showing how to use vector embeddings for implementing a recommendation engine.

* **Second Hand Shop** (https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/second-hand-shop):: Example that shows describing capabilities of Gen AI. You upload a product image, and the system fills a form with the name, description, ...

* **Autonomous Agent Bot** (https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/autonomous-agent-bot): Twitter Clone where a Bot monitors messages and reacts depending on the comments.

* **News Clustering** (https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/news-clustering-with-vectors): Example using vector embeddings for clustering news by topic.

* **LangGraph4J** https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/quarkus-langgraph-examples: From beginner to advanced use cases of LangGraph4j.

* **Mission Impossible** https://github.com/lordofthejars-ai/mission-impossible-rag: Example that integrates Quarkus and Docling and some advanced RAG techniques like Preserve encryption.
